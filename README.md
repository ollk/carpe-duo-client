### Overview
Carpe Duo is a React app built to help users organize and schedule a productive weekend.  Designed to supplement a conventional calendar app, Carpe Duo allows the user to first create a list of weekend tasks, then drag and drop these tasks into and around a weekend timeline to create a weekend schedule.  It's a dynamic to-do list and scheduling tool.

### Inspiration
Every weekend I go through the same routine. I scratch out a to-do list on a scrap of paper and try to mentally map out a rough plan of when I'll complete each item.  Too often, I end up missing the mark, over or underestimating how long it will all take, and scrambling on Sunday night to finish everything.  I created Carpe Duo to improve that weekend planning process.  I wanted a tool that would let me create AND schedule my to-do list, helping me to plan out a realistic set of weekend goals including time for rest and relaxation.

Users first set their Waking Hours for the weekend, setting the bounds of their Saturday and Sunday Timelines.  Waking Hours can be changed at any time.

When a Task is created, the user selects a Task name, duration (between thirty minutes and four hours), and priority (low, medium, or high).  When first created, Tasks are unscheduled.

Users schedule Tasks by dragging and dropping them onto the Timeline.  Task positions on the Timeline are saved with every move, so no need to worry about losing your schedule!
